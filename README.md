## How to build from command line

Below is an example of how to build the project on Unix based machine, however to clone you need to ask permission first to access this private repo @Dobberzoon on github.com.

Make sure you edit the CMakelists.txt, such that it finds the libraries from their relative paths accordingly.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Dobberzoon/geo1004.2022_hw02.git
$ cd geo1004.2022_hw02/hw/02/cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Or with zip file, extract and:

```
$ cd geo1004.2022_hw02/hw/02/cpp
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

Now, to start the program from the build folder in cmd line:

```
$ ./hw01
```


## Alternative build: simply use IDE of choice (e.g. CLion 2021.3)


## Add own path for input dataset
Change path for input_data location at line [placeholder] to link your local path accordingly.
